<p class="drop-cap"><i>S</i></p><p><i>tew.</i> Be patient Madam, you may have your pleasure.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Tis that I came to towne for, I wo'd not<br />
Endure againe the countrey conversation,<br />
To be the Lady of sixe shires I the men<br />
So neare the Primitive making, they retaine<br />
A sence of nothing but the earth, their braines<br />
And barren heads standing as much in want<br />
Of plowing as their ground, to heare a fellow<br />
Make himselfe merry and his horse with whisteling<br />
Sellingers round, to observe with what solemnitie<br />
They keepe their Wakes, and throw for pewter Candlestickes,<br />
How they become the Morris, whith whose bells<br />
They ring all into Whitson Ales, and sweate,<br />
Through twenty Scarffes and Napkins, till the Hobbyhorse<br />
Tire, and the maide Marrian dissolv'd to a gelly,<br />
Be kept for spoone meate.<br />
<br />
<i>Ste.</i> These with your pardon are no Argument<br />
To make the country life appeare so hatefull,<br />
At least to your particular, who enjoy'd<br />
A blessing in that calme; would you be pleasd<br />
To thinke so, and the pleasure of a kingdome,<br />
While your owne will commanded what should move<br />
Delight, your husbands love and power joyned<br />
To give your life more harmony, you liv'd there,<br />
Secure and innocent, beloved of all,<br />
Praisd for your hospitality, and praid for,<br />
You might be envied, but malice knew<br />
Not where you dwelt, I wo'd not prophecy<br />
But leave to your owne apprehension<br />
What may succeede your change.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> You doe imagine,<br />
No doubt, you have talk'd wisely, and confuted,<br />
London past all defence, your Master should<br />
Doe well to send you backe into the countrie,<br />
With title of Superintendent Baylie.<br />
<br />
<i>Ste.</i> How Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Even so sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Ste.</i> I am a Gentleman though now your servant.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> A country-gentleman,<br />
By your affection to converse with stuble,<br />
His tenants will advance your wit, and plumpe it so<br />
With beefe and bag-pudding.<br />
<br />
<i>Ste.</i> You may say your pleasure,<br />
It becomes not me dispute.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Complaine to the Lord of the soyle your master.<br />
<br />
<i>Ste.</i> Y'are a woman of an ungovern'd passion, and I pitty you.<br />
</p>

<div class="center"><i>Enter Sir Thomas Bornwell.</i></div>

<p>
<i>Bor.</i> How how? Whats the matter?<br />
<br />
<i>Ste.</i> Nothing Sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Angry sweeteheart?<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> I am angry with my selfe,<br />
To be so miserably restrained in things,<br />
Wherein it doth concern your love and honour<br />
To see me satisfied.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> In what <i>Aretina</i>?<br />
Dost thou accuse me? have I not obeyd<br />
All thy desires, against mine owne opinion,<br />
Quitted the countrie, and removed the hope<br />
Of our returne, by sale of that faire Lordship<br />
We liv'd in, chang'd a calme and retire life<br />
For this wild towne, composd of noise and charge.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> What charge more than is necessarie,<br />
For a lady of my birth and education?<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> I am not Ignorant, how much Nobilitie<br />
Flowes in your bloud, your kinsmen great and powerfull,<br />
I'th State, but with this lose not your memory<br />
Of being my wife, I shall be studious<br />
Madam to give the dignitie of your birth<br />
All the best ornaments which become my fortune<br />
But would not flatter it, to ruine both,<br />
And be the fable of the towne, to teach<br />
Other men losse of wit by mine, emploid<br />
To serve your vast expences. <i>Are.</i> Am I then<br />
Brought in the ballance? so Sir. <i>Bo.</i> Though you weigh<br />
Me in a partiall scale my heart is honest,<br />
And must take libertie to thinke you have<br />
Obeyed no modest counsell to effect,<br />
Nay study wayes of pride and costly ceremony,<br />
Your change of gaudy furniture and pictures,<br />
Of this Italian Master, and that Dutchmans.<br />
Your mighty looking-glasses like Artillery;<br />
Brought whom on Engins the superfluous plate,<br />
Anticke and novell, vanities of fires,<br />
Fourescore pound suppers for my Lord your kinsman,<br />
Banquets for tother Lady, aunt, and cozens,<br />
And perfumes that exceede all traine of servants,<br />
To stifle us at home and shew abroad<br />
More motley than the French, or the Venetian,<br />
About your Coach whose rude Postillion<br />
Must pester every narrow lane, till passengers<br />
And tradsmen curse your choaking up their stalls;<br />
And common cries pursue your Ladiship,<br />
For hindring o'their market. <i>Are.</i> Have you done sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> I could accuse the gayetie of your wardrobe,<br />
And prodigall embroderies under which<br />
Rich Sattens, Plushes, cloath of Silver, dare<br />
Not shew their owne complexions, your jewells<br />
Able to burne out the Spectators eyes,<br />
And shew like Bonefires on you by the tapers,<br />
Something might here be spar'd, which safely of<br />
Your birth and honour, since the truest wealth,<br />
Shines from the soule, and drawes up just admirers,<br />
I could urge something more: <i>Are.</i> Pray doe I like<br />
Your homilie of thrifte. <i>Bo.</i> I could wish Madam<br />
You would not game so much. <i>Are.</i> A gamster too?<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> But are not come to that repentance yet,<br />
Should teach you skill enough to raise your profit,<br />
You looke not through the subtiltie of Cards,<br />
And mysteries of Dice, nor can you save<br />
Charge with the boxe, buy petticotes and purles,<br />
And keepe your familie by the precious income,<br />
Nor doe I wish you should, my poorest servant<br />
Shall not upbraid my tables, nor his hire<br />
Purchasd beneath my honour, you make play<br />
Not a Pastime but a tyrannie, and vexe<br />
Your selfe and my estate by't. <i>Are.</i> Good, proceed.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Another game you have, which consumes more<br />
Your fame than purse, your revells in the night,<br />
Your meetings cal'd the Ball, to which appeare,<br />
As to the Court of Pleasure, all your gallants,<br />
And Ladies thither bound by a Subpena<br />
Of <i>Venus</i>, and small <i>Cupids</i> high displeasure,<br />
Tis but the family of love translated<br />
Into more costly sinne, there was a play on't,<br />
And had the Poet not beene brib'd to a modest<br />
Expression of your Anticke gambolls in't,<br />
Some darkes had beene discovered, and the deeds too,<br />
In time he may repent and make some blush,<br />
To see the second part danc'd on the Stage;<br />
My thoughts acquit you for dishonoring me<br />
By any foule act, but the vertuous know,<br />
Tis not enough to cleare our selves, but the<br />
Suspitions of our shame. <i>Are.</i> Have you concluded<br />
Your lecture? <i>Bor.</i> I ha done, and howsoever<br />
My language my appeare to you, it carries<br />
No other than my faire and just intent<br />
To your delights without curbe to their modestie<br />
And noble freedome. <i>Are.</i> Ile not be so tedious,<br />
In my reply, but without arte or elegance,<br />
Assure you I keepe still my first opinion,<br />
And though you vay'le, your avaritious meaning<br />
With hansome names of modesty, and thrift,<br />
I finde you would intrench and wound the liberty<br />
I was borne with, were my desires unpriviledged<br />
By example, while my judgement thought 'em fit,<br />
You ought not to oppose, but when the practise<br />
And tract of every honourable Lady,<br />
Authorise me, I take it great injustice,<br />
To have my pleasures circumscribed, and taught me,<br />
A narrow minded husband is a theefe<br />
To his owne fame, and his preferment too,<br />
He shuts his parts and fortunes from the world.<br />
While from the popular vote and knowledge men<br />
Rise to imployment in the state. <i>Bor.</i> I have<br />
No great ambition to buy preferment<br />
At so deare rate. <i>Are.</i> Nor I to sell my honour,<br />
By living poore and sparingly, I was not<br />
Bred in that ebbe of fortune, and my fate<br />
Shall not compell me too't. <i>Bor.</i> I know not Madam,<br />
But you pursue these wayes. <i>Are.</i> What wayes?<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> In the strict sence of honestie I dare<br />
Make oath, they are Innocent. <i>Are.</i> Do not divert,<br />
By busie troubling of your braine, those thoughts<br />
That should preserve em. <i>Bor.</i> How was that?<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Tis English.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> But carries some unkinde sence.<br />
</p>

<div class="center"><i>Enter Madam Decoy.</i></div>

<i>De.</i> Good morrow my sweete Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> <i>Decoy</i> welcome, this visite is a favour.<br />
<br />
<i>De.</i> Alas sweet Madam, I cannot stay, I came<br />
But to present my service to your Ladiship;<br />
I could not passe by your doore, but I must take<br />
The boldnesse to render my respects.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> You oblige me Madam, but I must<br />
Not dispence so with your absence.<br />
<br />
<i>De.</i> Alas, the Coach Madam stayes for me at the doore.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Thou shalt command mine, prethee sweete <i>Decoy</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>De.</i> I wou'd waite on you Madam, but I have many<br />
Visits to make this morning I beseech.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> So you will promise to dine with me. <i>De.</i> I shall<br />
Present a guest. <i>Are.</i> Why then good morrow Madam.<br />

<p>
<i>Are.</i> Whats your newes sir? <i>St.</i> Madam two gentlemen.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> What gentlemen? Have they no names. <i>St.</i> They are<br />
The gentleman with his owne head of haire,<br />
Whom you commended for his horsemanship<br />
In Hide Parke, and becomming the saddle<br />
The tother day. <i>Are.</i> What circumstance is this,<br />
To know him by. <i>St.</i> His names at my tongues end,<br />
He lik'd the fashion of your pearle chaine Madam,<br />
And borrowed it for his Jewelier to take<br />
A coppie by it. <i>Bor.</i> What cheating gallants this?<br />
<br />
<i>St.</i> That never walkes without a Ladies buske,<br />
And playes with fannes Mr. <i>Alexander Kickshaw</i>,<br />
I thought I should remember him. <i>Are.</i> Whats the other?<br />
<br />
<i>St.</i> What an unluckie memorie I have?<br />
The gallant that still danceth in the streete,<br />
And weares a grosse of Ribbon in his hat,<br />
That carries <i>Oringado</i> in his pocket,<br />
And Suger-plumbs to sweeten his discourse,<br />
That studies complement, defies all wit<br />
On blacke and censures playes that are not bawdy,<br />
Mr. <i>John Littleworth</i>. <i>Are.</i> They are welcome, but<br />
Pray entertaine them a small time, lest I<br />
Be unprovided. <i>Bor.</i> Did they aske for me?<br />
<br />
<i>Ste.</i> No sir. <i>Bor.</i> It matters not, they must be welcome.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Fie, how's this haire disordered? here's a curle,<br />
Straddle most impiously, I must to my closet.       <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Exit.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Waite on em my Lady will returne agen,<br />
I have to such a height fulfill'd her humor,<br />
All applications dangerous, these gallants<br />
Must be received or shee will fall into<br />
A tempest, and the house be shooke with names<br />
Of all her kindred, tis a servitude,<br />
I may in time shake off.<br />
</p>

<div class="center"><i>Enter Alexander and Littleworth.</i></div>

<p>
<i>Al. Lit.</i> Save you Sir <i>Thomas</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Save you gentlemen. <i>Al.</i> I kisse your hand.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> What day is it abroad?<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> The morning rises from your Ladies eye,<br />
If she looke cleare we take the happy omen<br />
Of a faire day. <i>Bo.</i> Sheele instantly appeare,<br />
To the discredit of your complement,<br />
But you expresse your wit thus. <i>Al.</i> And you modestie,<br />
Nor to affect praises of your owne.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Leaving this subject, what games now on foote?<br />
What exercise carries the generall vote?<br />
Oth towne now nothing moves without your knowledge.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> The cocking now has all the noise, Ile have<br />
A hundred peeces of one battle, Oh,<br />
These birds of <i>Mars</i>! <i>Lit.</i> <i>Venus</i> is <i>Mars</i> his bird too.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Why and the pretty Doves are <i>Venusses</i>,<br />
To show that kisses draw the Charriot.<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> I am for that skirmish. <i>Bor.</i> When shall wee have<br />
More Booths and Bag-pipes upon Bansted downes,<br />
No mighty race is expected, but my Lady returnes.<br />
</p>

<div class="center"><i>Enter Aretina.</i></div>

<p>
<i>Are.</i> Faire morning to you gentlemen,<br />
You went not late to bed by your early visit,<br />
You doe me honour. <i>Al.</i> It becomes our service.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> What newes abroade? you hold precious intelligence.<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> All tongues are so much busie with your praise,<br />
They have not time to frame other discourse,<br />
Will please you Madam? tast a Sugerplum.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> What do's the Goldsmith thinke the Pearle is worth<br />
You borrowed of my Lady? <i>Al.</i> Tis a rich one.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> She has many other toyes whose fashion you,<br />
Will like extremely, you have no intention<br />
To buy any of her Iewels.  <i>Al.</i> Vnderstand me.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> You had rather sell perhaps, but leaving this?<br />
I hope you'le dine with us.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> I came a purpose.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> And where were you last night? <i>Al.</i> I Madam? where<br />
I slept not, it had beene sin where so much<br />
Delight and beauty was to keepe me waking,<br />
There is a Lady Madam will be worth<br />
Your free societie, my conversation<br />
Nere knew so elegant and brave a soule,<br />
With most incomparable flesh and bloud,<br />
So spirited, so Courtly speakes the Languages,<br />
Sings, Dances, playes o'th Lute to admiration,<br />
Is faire and paints not, games too, keepes a table,<br />
And talkes most witty Satyre, has a wit<br />
Of a cleane Mercury.<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> Is shee married? <i>Al.</i> No.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> A Virgin? <i>Al.</i> Neither. <i>Lit.</i> What a widow? something<br />
Of this wide commendation might have beene<br />
Excusd, this such a prodigie? <i>Al.</i> Repent<br />
Before I name her, shee did never see<br />
Yet full sixteene, an age in the opinion<br />
Of wise men not contemptible, she ha's<br />
Mourned out her yeare too for the honest Knight<br />
That had compassion of her youth, and dy'd<br />
So timely, such a widow is not common,<br />
And now she shines more fresh and tempting<br />
Then any naturall Virgin.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Whats her name?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Shee was Christened <i>Celestina</i>, by her husband<br />
The Lady <i>Bellamour</i>, this Ring was hers.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> You borrowed it to coppie out the Posie.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Are they not pretty Rubies? twas a grace<br />
She was pleasd to shew me, that I might have one<br />
Made of the same fashion, for I love<br />
All prettie formes. <i>Are.</i> And is she glorious?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> She is full of Jewels Madam, but I am<br />
Most taken with the bravery of her minde,<br />
Although her garments have all grace and ornament.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> You have beene high in praises. <i>Al.</i> I come short,<br />
No flattery can reach her. <i>Bor.</i> Now my Lady<br />
Is troubled as she feared to be eclipsd,<br />
This newes will cost me somewhat. <i>Are.</i> You deserve<br />
Her favour for this noble character.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> And I possesse it by my starres benevolence.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> You must bring us acquainted. <i>Bo.</i> I pray doe sir,<br />
I long to see her too, Madam I have<br />
Thought upon't and corrected my opinion,<br />
Pursue what wayes of pleasure your desires<br />

To exercise your pen in your account Booke?<br />
Of doe you doubt my credit to discharge<br />

<i>St.</i> Madam, I hope you have not found<br />
My dutie with the guilt of sloath or jealousie,<br />
Vnapt to your command. <i>Cel.</i> You can extenuate<br />
Your faults with language sir, but I expect<br />
To be obeyed; What hangings have we here?<br />
<br />
<i>St.</i> They are Arras Madam. <i>Cel.</i> Impudence I know't,<br />
I will have fresher and more rich, not wrought<br />
With faces that may scandalise a Christian<br />
With Iewish stories stufft with Corne and Camells,<br />
You had best wrap all my chambers in wild Irish,<br />

To fright the Ladies comes to visite me.<br />

Your fame is precious to you. <i>Cel.</i> I were best<br />
Make you my governor; audacious Varlet,<br />

I will pursue 'em in what shapes I fancie,<br />
Here, and abroad, my entertainements shall<br />
Be oftner, and more rich, who shall controule me?<br />
I live i'th strand, whether few Ladies come<br />

Be hospitable then, and spare no cost<br />
That may engage all generous report<br />

My house the Academy of wits, who shall<br />

Write Panegyricks of my feasts, and praise<br />
The method of my wittie superfluities,<br />
The horses shall be taught with frequent waiting<br />
Vpon my gates, to stop in their careere<br />
Toward Charing-crosse, spight of the Coachmans fury.<br />
And not a tilter, but shall strike his plume,<br />
When he sailes by my window, my Balconie<br />

So farre to understand it, I did alwayes<br />
Suspect they would corrupt him in the Colledge,<br />
Will your Greeke sawes and sentences discharge<br />
The Mercer, or is Latin a fit language<br />

If you have any charitie, let me<br />

Themselves without her chargeable proclamations;<br />
Then we are worse than Citizens, no widow<br />
Left wealthy can be throughly warme in mourning,<br />
But some one noble bloud or lusty kindred<br />
Claps in, with his gilt coach, and Flandrian trotters,<br />
And hurries her away to be a Countesse.<br />
Courtiers have spies, and great ones with lharge titles,<br />
Cold in their owne estates, would warme themselves<br />

In my thoughts miserable to be fond<br />

You see me merry, full of song and dancing,<br />
Pleasant in language, apt to all delights<br />
That crowne a publike meeting, but you cannot<br />
Accuse me of being prodigall of my favours<br />
To any of my guests, I doe not summon<br />
By any winke, a gentleman to follow me,<br />
To my withdrawing chamber, I heare all<br />
Their pleaes in Court, nor can they boast abroad<br />
And doe me justice, after a salute<br />
They have much conversation with my lippe,<br />
I hold the kissing of my hand a courtesie,<br />
And he that loves me, must upon the strength<br />
Of that, expect till I renew his favour.<br />
Some Ladies are so expensive in their graces,<br />
To those that honour 'em, and so prodigall<br />
That in a little time, they have nothing but<br />
The naked sinne left to reward their servants,<br />
Whereas a thrift in our rewards, will keepe<br />
Men long in their devotion, and preserve<br />
Our selves in stocke, to encourage those that honour us.<br />
<br />
<i>Is.</i> This is an art worthy a Ladies practise.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> It takes not from the freedome of our mirth,<br />
But seemes to advance it, when we can possesse<br />
Our pleasures with security of our honour,<br />
And that preservd, I welcome all the joyes<br />
My fancy can let in. In this I have given<br />
The copie of my minde, nor doe I blush,<br />
You understand it.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter Celestinaes gentlewoman.</i></span><br />

Of little land, his expectation is not<br />
So valiant as it might be, he weares cloathes,<br />
And feeds with noblemen, to some I heare<br />
No better than a wanton emissarie,<br />
Or scout for <i>Venus</i> wild soule, which made tame,<br />
He thinkes no shame to stand court centinell,<br />
In hope of the reversion. <i>Mar.</i> I have heard<br />
That some of them are often my Lords tasters,<br />
The first fruits they condition for, and will<br />
Exact as fees for the promotion.<br />

Give me a living mistresse, with but halfe<br />
The beauty of <i>Celestina</i>, come my Lord,<br />
Tis pitty that a Lord of so much flesh<br />
Should waste upon a ghost, when they are living<br />
Can give you a more honourable consumption.<br />
<br />
<i>Sen.</i> Why doe you meane my Lord to live an Infidell?<br />
Doe, and see what will come ont, observe still<br />
And dote upon your vigills, build a chamber<br />
Within a rocke, a tombe, among the wormes,<br />
Not farre off, where you may in proofe apocryphall<br />
Court em not devoure the pretty pile.<br />
Of flesh your mistresse carried to the grave,<br />
There are no women in the world, all eyes<br />
And tongue and lippes are buried in her coffin.<br />

<i>Lor.</i> Why doe you thinke your selves competent Judges,<br />
Of beauty gentlemen? <i>Both.</i> What should hinder us?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> I have seene and tried as many as another<br />
With a mortall backe. <i>Lord.</i> Your eyes are bribd,<br />
And your hearts chain'd to some desires, you cannot<br />
Enjoy the freedome of a sence. <i>Alex.</i> Your Lordship<br />
Has a cleare eyesight, and can judge and penetrate.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> I can, and give a perfect censure of<br />
Each line and point, distinguish beautie from<br />
A thousand formes, which your corrupted optiks<br />
Would passe for naturall. <i>Sent.</i> I desire no other<br />
Judge should determine us, and if your Lordship<br />
Dare venture but your eyes upon this Lady,<br />
Ile stand their justice, and be confident<br />
You shall give <i>Celestine</i> victorie,<br />
And triumph ors all beauties past and living.<br />

Which holds the best acquaintance to prepare<br />
My visit to her.<br />
<br />
<i>Sent.</i> I will doo't my Lord.<br />

<i>Lor.</i> I would give this advantage to your cause,<br />
Bid him appeare in all the ornaments<br />
Did ever waite on beautie, all the riches<br />
Pride can put on, and teach her face more charme<br />
Then ever Poet drest up <i>Venus</i> in,<br />
Bid her be all the graces, and the queene<br />
Of love in one, Ile see her <i>Sentlove</i>, and<br />
Bring off my heart arm'd, but single thought<br />
Of one that is dead, without a wound, and when<br />
I have made your follie prisoner, ile laugh at you.<br />

So neere conversion. <i>Alex.</i> I am for <i>Aretina</i>.<br />

Of clothes and painting, and not halfe so hansome<br />
As that which plaid <i>Susanna</i> in the faire.<br />

One of their constant audience, and so taken<br />

Have I no sinne but pride? <i>Al.</i> Hast any vertue?<br />
Or but a good face to excuse that want?<br />

<i>Cel.</i> You prais'd it yesterday. <i>Al.</i> That made you proud.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> More pride? <i>Al.</i> You neede not to close up the praise,<br />
I have seene a better countenance in a Sibill.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> When you wore spectacles of sacke, mistooke<br />
The painted cloath, and kist it for your mistresse.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Let me aske you a question, how much<br />
Have you consum'd in expectation<br />
That I would love you. <i>Cel.</i> Why? I thinke as much<br />
As you have paid away in honest debts<br />
This seven yeare, tis a pretty impudence,<br />
But cannot make me angry. <i>Lit.</i> Is there any<br />
Man that will cast away his limbes upon her?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> You doe not sing so well as I imagind,<br />
Nor dance, you reele in your coranto, and pinch<br />
Your petticoate too hard, y'ave no good eare<br />
Toth' musicke, and incline too much one shoulder,<br />
As you were dancing on the rope, and falling,<br />
You speake abominable French, and make<br />
A courtsey like a Dairie maide, not mad?<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> Doe we not sting her hansomely. <i>Bor.</i> A conspiracie.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Your state is not so much as tis reported<br />
When you conferre notes, all your husbands debts<br />
And your owne reconcild&mdash;&mdash;but thats not it<br />
Will so much spoile your marriage. <i>Cel.</i> As what sir?<br />
Let me know all my faults. <i>Al.</i> Some men doe whisper<br />
You are not over honest. <i>Cel.</i> All this shall not<br />
Move me to more than laughter, and some pittie,<br />
Because you have the shapes of gentlemen,<br />
And though you have beene insolent upon me,<br />
I will engage no friend to kicke or cudgell you<br />
To spoile your living, and your limbes together,<br />
I leave that to diseases that offend you,<br />
And spare my curse, poore silken Vermine, and<br />
Hereafter shall distinguish Men from Monkies.<br />

Their barbarous language Madam, ya're too mercifull,<br />
They shall be silent to your tongue, pray punish e'm.<br />

Of any cleane breath, so lost in honesty<br />
They cannot satisfie for wrongs enough,<br />
Though they should steale out of the world at Tiburne.<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> We are hang'd already.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> Yet I will talke a little to the pilchards,<br />
You two that have not twixt you both the hundred<br />
Part of a soule, course woollen witted fellowes,<br />
Without a nap, with bodies made for burdens,<br />
You that are onely stuffings for apparrell<br />
As you were made but engines for your Taylors<br />
To frame their clothes upon, and get them custome;<br />
Vntill men see you moove, yet, then you dare not<br />
Out of your guilt of being the ignobler beast<br />
But give a horse the wall, whom you excell<br />
Onely in dancing of the brawles, because<br />
The horse was not taught the French way, your two faces,<br />
One fat like Christmas, tother leane like Candlemas,<br />
And Prologue to a Lent, both bound together<br />
Would figure <i>Ianus</i>, and doe many cures<br />
On Agues and the greene disease by frighting,<br />
But neither can with all the characters<br />
And conjuring circles charme a woman, though<br />
Sha'd fourescore yeares upon her, and but one<br />
Tooth in her head, to love, or thinke well of you;<br />
And I were miserable, to be at cost<br />
To court such a complexion, as your malice<br />
Did impudently insinuate, but I waste time<br />
And staine my breath in talking to such tadpoles.<br />
Goe home and wash your tongues in Barly water,<br />
Drinke cleane Tobacco, be not hot i'th mouth,<br />
And you may scape the Beadle; so I leave you<br />
To shame and your owne garters. Sir I must<br />
Entreate you for my honour doe not pennance em,<br />
They are not worth your anger, how I shall<br />
Acquit your Ladies silence.<br />

Pray heaven they were not Bayliefes, thats more worth<br />
My feare, and this a prison, all my debts<br />
Reeke in my nostrill, and may bones beginne<br />
To ake with feare to be made dice, and yet<br />
This is too calme and quiet for a prison;<br />
What if the riddle prove I am robd; and yet<br />
I did not feele em search me? How now? musicke?<br />

<div class="center"><i>Enter Decoy like an old woman with a light.</i></div>

And a light? What beldam's this, I cannot pray;<br />
What art? <i>De.</i> A friend, feare not young man I am<br />
No spirit. <i>Alex.</i> Off. <i>De.</i> Despise me not for age,<br />
Or this course outside, which I weare not out<br />
Of poverty; thy eyes be witnesse tis<br />
No cave or beggars cell tha'rt brought too, let<br />
That gold speake here's no want, which thou maist spend,<br />
And finde a spring to tire even prodigality<br />
If thou beest wise. <i>Alex.</i> The devill was a coyner<br />
From the beginning, yet the gold lookes currant.<br />
<br />
<i>De.</i> Tha'rt still in wonder, know I am Mistresse of<br />
This house, and of a fortune that shall serve<br />
And feed thee with delights, twas J sent for thee,<br />
The jewell and the letter came from me.<br />
It was my art, thus to contrive our meeting,<br />
Because J would not trust thee with my fame,<br />
Vntill J found thee worth a womans honor.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Honour and fame? the devill meanes to have<br />
A care on's credit, though she sent for me,<br />
J hope, she has another customer<br />
To doe the tricke withall, J wod not turne<br />
Familiar to a witch. <i>De.</i> What saist? Canst thou<br />
Dwell in my armes to night, shall we change kisses,<br />
And entertaine the silent houres with pleasure?<br />
Such as old time shall be delighted with,<br />
And blame the too swifte motion of his wings<br />
While we embrace? <i>Al.</i> Embrace? She has had no teeth<br />
This twenty years, and the next violent cough<br />
Brings up her tongue, it cannot possibly<br />
Be sound at root, I doe not thinke but one<br />
Strong sneeze upon her, and well mean't would make<br />
Her quarters fall away, one kicke would blow<br />
Her up like gunpowder, and loose all her limbs;<br />
She is so cold, an <i>Incubus</i> wod not heate her,<br />
Her phlegme would quench a furnace, and her breath<br />
Would dampe a musket bullet. <i>De.</i> Have you sir<br />
Considerd. <i>Alex.</i> What? <i>De.</i> My proposition,<br />
Canst love? <i>Alex.</i> I could have done, whom doe you meane?<br />
I know you are pleased, but to make sport. <i>De.</i> Thou art not<br />
So dull of soule as thou appearst. <i>Alex.</i> This is<br />
But some device, my granam has some tricke in't:<br />
Yes I can love. <i>De.</i> But canst thou affect me.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Although to reverence so grave a matron<br />
Were an ambitious word in me; yet since<br />
You give me boldnesse, I doe love you. <i>De.</i> Then<br />
Thou art my owne. <i>Al.</i> Has she no cloven foote?<br />
<br />
<i>De.</i> And I am thine, and all that I command<br />
Thy servants, from this minute thou art happy,<br />
And fate in thee will crowne all my desires.<br />
I griev'd a proper man should be compeld<br />
To bring his body to the common market,<br />
My wealth shall make thee glorious, and the more<br />
To encourage thee, how ere this forme may fright<br />
Thy youthfull eyes, yet thou wo't find by light<br />
Of thy owne sense, for other light is banish'd<br />
My chamber, when our armes tie lovers knots,<br />
And kisses seale the welcome of our lippes,<br />
I shall not there affright thee, nor seeme old,<br />
With riveld veines, my skin is smooth and softe<br />
As <i>Ermines</i>, with a spirit to meete thine,<br />
Active and equall to the queene of Loves<br />
When she did court <i>Adonis</i>. <i>Al.</i> This doth more<br />
Confirme she is a devill, and I am<br />
Within his owne dominions, I must on,<br />
Or else be torne a peeces, I have heard<br />
These Succubi must not be crost. <i>De.</i> We trifle<br />
Too precious time away, Ile shew you a prospect<br />
Of the next chamber, and then out the candle.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Have you no sacke i'th house, I would goe arm'd<br />

Mother, have not you beene a Cat in your dayes?<br />
<br />
<i>De.</i> I am glad you are so merry sir, you observe<br />
That bed. <i>Alex.</i> A very brave one. <i>De.</i> When you are<br />

<div class="center"><i>Enter Fred. Littlew. Steward.</i></div>

<p>
<i>Fre.</i> And how dee like me now? <i>St.</i> Most excellent.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> Your opinion Mr. <i>Littlewor</i>. <i>Lit.</i> Your French tailor<br />
Has made you a perfect gentleman, I may<br />
Converse now with you, and preserve my credit,<br />
De'e find no alteration in your body<br />
With these new clothes? <i>Fre.</i> My body altered? No.<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> You are not yet in fashion then, that must<br />
Have a new motion garbe, and posture too,<br />
Or all your pride is cast away, it is not<br />
The cut of your apparrell makes a gallant,<br />
But the geometricall wearing of your clothes.<br />
<br />
<i>St.</i> Mr. <i>Littleworth</i> tells you right, you weare your hat<br />
Too like a citizen. <i>Lit.</i> Tis like a Midwife,<br />
Place it with best advantage of your haire,<br />
Is halfe your feather molted? this does make<br />
No shew, it should spread over like a Canopy,<br />
Your hot reind Monsieur weares it for a shade,<br />
And cooler to his backe, your doublet must<br />
Be more unbutton'd hereabouts, you'le not<br />
Be a sloven else, a foule shirt is no blemish,<br />
You must be confident, and outface cleane linnen<br />
Your doublet and your breeches must be allow'd<br />
No private meeting here, your cloak's too long,<br />
It reaches to your buttocke, and doth smell<br />
Too much of Spanish gravitie, the fashion<br />
Is to weare nothing but a Cape, a coate<br />
May be allowed a covering for one elbow,<br />
And some to avoid the trouble, choose to walke<br />
In quirpo thus. <i>St.</i> Your coat, and cloak's a brushing<br />
In Long-lane Lumbard. <i>Fre.</i> But what if it raine?<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> Your belt about your shoulder is sufficient<br />
To keepe off any storme, beside a reede<br />
But wau'd discreetly, has so many pores,<br />
It suckes up all the raine that falls about one,<br />
With this defence, when other men have beene<br />
Wet to the skin through all their cloakes, I have<br />
Defied a tempest and walked by the Tavernes<br />
Drie as a bone. <i>St.</i> Because he had no money<br />
To call for wine. <i>Fr.</i> Why you doe walke enchanted,<br />
Have you such pretty charmes in towne? But stay,<br />
Who must I have to attend me? <i>Lit.</i> Is not that<br />
Yet thought upon. <i>St.</i> I have laid out for servants.<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> They are every where. <i>St.</i> I cannot yet be furnish'd<br />
With such as I would put into his hands.<br />
<br />
<i>Fr.</i> Of what condition must they be, and how<br />
Many in number sir? <i>Lit.</i> Beside your fencing,<br />
Your singing, dancing, riding, and French-master,<br />
Two may serve domesticke to be constant waiters<br />
Vpon a gentleman, a foole, a pimpe.<br />
<br />
<i>St.</i> For these two officers I have enquird,<br />
And I am promisd a convenient whiskin,<br />
I could save charges, and employ the Pye wench<br />
That carries her intelligence in whitepots,<br />
Or tis but taking order with the woman<br />
That holds the ballads, she could fit him with<br />
A concubin to any tune, but I<br />
Have a designe to place a fellow with him<br />
That has read all Sir <i>Pandarus</i> workes, a Trojan<br />
That lies conceal'd, and is acquainted with<br />
Both citty and sub urbian fripperies<br />
Can fetch em with a spell at midnight to him,<br />
And warrant which are for his turne, can for<br />
A neede supply the Surgeon too. <i>Fre.</i> I like<br />
Thy providence,&mdash;such a one deserves a livery twice a yeare.<br />
<br />
<i>St.</i> It shanot need, a cast suite of your worships<br />
Will serve, he'le find a cloke to cover it<br />
Out of his share with those he brings to bed to you.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> But must I call this fellow Pimpe? <i>Lit.</i> It is<br />
Not necessary, or <i>Jacke</i> or <i>Harry</i>,<br />
Or what hees knowne abroad by will sound better,<br />
That men may thinke he is a Christian.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> But heare you Mr. <i>Littleworth</i>, is there not<br />
A method, and degrees of title in<br />
Men of this art. <i>Lit.</i> According to the honour<br />
Of men that doe employ em. An Emperour<br />
May give this office to a Duke, A King<br />
May have his Viceroy to negotiate for him,<br />
A Duke may use a Lord, the Lord a Knight.<br />
A Knight may trust a gentleman, and when<br />
They are abroad, and merry, gentlemen<br />
May pimpe to one another. <i>Fre.</i> Good, good fellowship!<br />
But for the foole now, that should waite on me,<br />
And breake me jeasts. <i>Lit.</i> A foole is necessary.<br />
<br />
<i>St.</i> By any meanes. <i>Fre.</i> But which of these two servants<br />
Must now take place. <i>Lit.</i> That question Mr. <i>Fredericke</i><br />
The schoole of Heraldry should conclude upon;<br />
But if my judgement may be heard, the foole<br />
Is your first man, and it is knowne a point<br />
Of state to have a foole. <i>St.</i> But sir the other<br />
Is held the finer servant, his employments<br />
Are full of trust, his person cleane, and nimble,<br />
And none so soone can leape into preferment<br />
Where fooles are poore. <i>Lit.</i> Not all, theres story for't,<br />
Princes have beene no wiser than they should be,<br />
Would any noble man, that were no foole<br />
Spend all in hope of the Philosophers stone,<br />
To buy new Lordships in another countrey,<br />
Would Knights build Colledges, or gentlemen<br />
Of good estates, challenge the field and fight<br />
Because a whore wo'not be honest, come,<br />
Fooles are a family over all the world;<br />
We doe affect one naturally, indeede<br />
The foole is Leiger with us. <i>St.</i> Then the Pimpe<br />
Is extraordinary. <i>Fre.</i> Doe not you fall out<br />
About their places; here's my noble Aunt!      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter Aretina.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> How doe you like your nephew Madam now?<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Well, turne about <i>Fredricke</i>, very well.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> Am I not now a proper gentleman?<br />
The vertue of rich clothes! now could I take<br />
The wall of <i>Iulius Cesar</i>, affront<br />
Great <i>Pompeys</i> upperlip, and defie the Senate,<br />
Nay I can be as proud as your owne heart Madam,<br />
You may take that for your comfort; J put on<br />
That vertue with my clothes, and J doubt not<br />
But in a little time, J shall be impudent<br />
As any Page or Players boy, J am<br />
Beholding to this gentleman's good discipline,<br />
But J shall doe him credit in my practise,<br />
Your Steward has some pretty notions too<br />
In morall mischiefe. <i>Are.</i> Your desert in this<br />
Exceedes all other service, and shall bind me<br />
Both to acknowledge, and reward. <i>Lit.</i> Sweet Madam!<br />
Thinke me but worth your favour, J wo'd creepe<br />
Vpon my knees to honour you and for every<br />
Minute you lend to my reward, ile pay<br />
A yeare of serviceable tribute. <i>Are.</i> You<br />
Can complement. <i>Lit.</i> Thus still she puts me off,<br />
Vnlesse J speake the downe right word, she'le never<br />
Vnderstand me, a man would thinke that creeping<br />
Vpon one's knees Were English to a Lady.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter Alex.</i></span><br />

<i>Ale.</i> How ist <i>Iacke</i>? Pleasures attend you Madam,<br />
How does my plant of honour? <i>Are.</i> Who is this?<br />

<i>Al.</i> Tis <i>Alexander</i>. <i>Are.</i> Rich and glorious!<br />

<i>Lit.</i> Tis <i>Alexander</i> the great. <i>Ale.</i> And my <i>Bucephalus</i><br />
Waites at the doore. <i>Are.</i> Your case is alterd sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Ale.</i> J cannot helpe these things, the Fates will have it,<br />
Tis not my land does this. <i>Lit.</i> But thou hast a plough<br />
That brings it in. <i>Are.</i> Now he lookes brave and lovely.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> Welcome my gallant Macedonian.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Madam, you gave your Nephew for my pupill,<br />
I rea'd but in a taverne, if you'le honour us,<br />
The Beare at the bridge foote shall entertaine you,<br />
A drawer is my Ganimed, he shall skinke<br />
Briske <i>Nectar</i> to us, we will onely have<br />
A dozen Partridge in a dish, as many Phesants,<br />
Quailes, Cockes and Godwits, shall come marching up<br />
Like the train'd band, a sort of Sturgeon<br />
Shall give most bold defiance to an army,<br />
And triumph ore the table. <i>Are.</i> Sir, it will<br />
But dull the appetite to heare more, and mine<br />
Must be excusd, another time I may<br />
Be your guest. <i>Ale.</i> Tis growne in fashion now with Ladies,<br />
When you please ile attend you; <i>Littleworth</i>.<br />
Come <i>Fredericke</i>. <i>Fre.</i> Weele have musicke, I love noise,<br />
We will out roare the Thames and shake the bridge boy.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Ex.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> Madam I kisse your hand, wod you wod thinke<br />
Of your poore servant, flesh and bloud is fraile,<br />
And troublesome to carry without helpe.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> A coach will easily convey it, or<br />
You may take water at strand bridge. <i>Lit.</i> But I<br />
Have taken fire. <i>Are.</i> The Thames will coole.<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> But never quench my heart, your charitie<br />
Can onely doe that! <i>Are.</i> I will keepe it cold<br />
Of purpose, <i>Lit.</i> Now you blesse me, and I dare<br />
Be drunke in expectation. <i>Are.</i> I am confident<br />
He knowes me not, and I were worse than mad<br />
To be my owne betrayer, here's my husband.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter Born.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Why, how now <i>Aretina</i>? What alone?<br />
The mystery of this solitude? my house<br />
Turne desart o'the sudaine, all the gamsters<br />
Blowne up? Why is the musicke put to silence?<br />
Or ha their instruments caught a cold, since we<br />
Gave e'm the last heate? I must know thy ground<br />
Of Melancholy. <i>Are.</i> You are merry, as<br />
You came from kissing <i>Celestina</i>. <i>Bor.</i> I<br />
Feele her yet warme upon my lip, she is<br />
Most excellent company, I did not thinke<br />
There was that sweetnesse in her sexe, I must<br />
Acknowledge twas thy cure to disinchant me<br />
From a dull husband to an active lover,<br />
With such a Lady, I could spend more yeeres,<br />
Than since my birth my glasse hath run soft minutes,<br />
And yet be young, her presence has a spell<br />
To keepe off age, she has an eye would strike<br />
Fire through an adamant. <i>Are.</i> I have heard as much<br />
Bestow'd upon a dull fac'd chambermaid<br />
Whom love and wit would thus commend, true beauty<br />
Is mock'd when we compare thus, it selfe being<br />
Above what can be fetch'd to make it lovely,<br />
Or could our thoughts reach some thing to declare<br />
The glories of a face, or bodies elegance,<br />
That touches but our sense, when beauty spreads<br />
Over the soule, and calls up understanding<br />
To looke when thence is offer'd, and admire,<br />
In both I must acknowledge <i>Celestina</i><br />
Most excellently faire, faire above all<br />
The beauties I ha seene, and one most worthy<br />
Mans love and wonder. <i>Bor.</i> Doe you speake <i>Aretina</i>,<br />
This with a pure sence to commend, or ist<br />
The mockery of my praise. <i>Aret.</i> Although it shame<br />
My selfe, I must be just, and give her all<br />
The excellency of women, and were I<br />
A man. <i>Bo.</i> What then? <i>Are.</i> I know not with what losse,<br />
I should attempt her love, she is a peece<br />
So angellically moving, I should thinke<br />
Frailty excusd to dote upon her forme,<br />
And almost vertue to be wicked with her.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Exit.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> What should this meane? this is no jealousie,<br />
Or she beleeves I counterfeit, I feele<br />
Something within me, like a heate, to give<br />
Her cause, would <i>Celestina</i> but consent,<br />
What a fraile thing is man, it is not worth<br />
Our glory to be chaste, while we deny<br />
Mirth and converse with women, he is good<br />
That dares the tempter, yet corrects his bloud.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Exit.</i></span><br />

<i>Cel.</i> Though I am poore in language to expresse<br />
How much your Lordship honors me, my heart<br />
Is rich and proud in such a guest, I shall<br />
Be out of love with every aire abroad,<br />
And for his grace done my unworthy house,<br />
Be a fond prisoner, become anchorite,<br />
And spend my houres in prayer, to reward<br />
The blessing, and the bounty of this presence.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> Though you could turne each place you move in, to<br />
A temple, rather than a wall should hide<br />
So rich a beauty from the world, it were<br />
Lesse want to lose our piety and your prayer,<br />

<i>Lo.</i> You make me smile Madam. <i>Cel.</i> I hope you came not<br />
With feare that any sadnesse here should shake<br />
One blossome from your eye, I should be miserable<br />

<i>Lo.</i> You doe not Madam. <i>Cel.</i> As I should account<br />
It no lesse sorrow, if your Lordship should<br />
Lay too severe a censure on my freedome.<br />
I wonot court a Prince against his justice,<br />
Nor bribe him with a smile to thinke me honest,<br />
Pardon my Lord this boldnesse, and the mirth<br />
That may flow from me, I beleeve my father<br />
Thought of no winding sheete when he begot me.<br />

<i>Lor.</i> She has a merry soule, it will become<br />

Though I have but seene your person a farre off,<br />
I am acquainted with your character,<br />

<i>Lo.</i> You shall doe me an honor. <i>Cel.</i> If your Lordship will<br />

<i>Cel.</i> That as your conscience can agree upon em,<br />
How ever if your Lordship give me priviledge,<br />
Ile tell you whats the opinion of the world.<br />
<br />
<i>Lo.</i> You cannot please me better. <i>Cel.</i> Y'are a Lord<br />
Borne with as much nobilitie as would<br />
Divided serve to make ten noble men<br />
Without a Herald, but with so much spirit,<br />
And height of soule, as well might furnish twenty.<br />
You are learnd, a thing not compatible now<br />
With native honour, and are master of<br />
A language that doth chaine all yeares, and charme<br />
All hearts, where you perswade, a wit so flowing<br />
And prudence to correct it, that all men<br />
Beleeve they onely meete in you, which with<br />
A spacious memory make up the full wonders;<br />
To these you have knowne valour, and upon<br />
A noble cause, know how to use a sword<br />
To honors best advantage, though you were none;<br />
You are as bountifull, as the showers that fall<br />
Into the Springs greene bosome; as you were<br />
Created Lord of fortune, not her steward;<br />
So constant to the cause, in which you make<br />
Your selfe an advocate, you dare all dangers,<br />
And men had rather you should be their friend,<br />
Than justice or the bench, bound up together.<br />

<i>Lor.</i> But did you heare all this. <i>Cel.</i> And more my Lord.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> Pray let me have it Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> To all these vertues, there is added one,<br />
(Your Lordship will remember when I name it,<br />
I speake but what I gather from the voyce<br />

That you have lov'd a woman. <i>Lo.</i> But one Madam?<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> Yes many, give me leave to smile my Lord,<br />
I shall not neede to interpret in what sence,<br />
But you have shewd your selfe right honorable,<br />
And for your love to Ladies have deserv'd,<br />
If their vote might prevaile a marble statue,<br />
I make no comment on the peoples text.<br />
My Lord I should be sorry to offend.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> You cannot Madam, these are things we owe<br />
To nature for. <i>Cel.</i> And honest men will pay<br />
Their debts. <i>Lo.</i> If they be able, or compound.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> She had a hard heart, would be unmercifull,<br />
And not give day to men so promising,<br />
But you ow'd women nothing. <i>Lo.</i> Yes I am<br />
Still in their debt, and I must owe them love,<br />
It was part of my character. <i>Cel.</i> With your Lordships<br />
Pardon I onely said, you had a fame<br />
For loving women, but of late men say<br />
You have against the imperiall lawes of love,<br />
Restraind the active flowings of your bloud,<br />
And with a Mistris buried all that is<br />
Hop'd for in loves succession, as all beauty<br />
Had died with her, and left the world benighted!<br />
In this you more dishonor all our sexe<br />
Than you did grace a part, when every where<br />
Love tempts your eye to admire a glorious harvest,<br />
And every where as full blowne eares submit<br />
Their golden heads, the laden trees bow downe<br />
Their willing fruit, and court your amorous tasting.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> I see men would dissect me to a fibre,<br />
But doe you beleeve this? <i>Cel.</i> It is my wonder!<br />
I must confesse a man of nobler earth<br />
Then goes to vulgar composition,<br />
Borne and bred high, so unconfind, so rich<br />
In fortunes, and so read in all that summe<br />
Vp humane knowledge, to feed gloriously,<br />
And live at court, the onely spheare wherein<br />
True beauty moves, natures most wealthy garden,<br />
Where every blossome is more worth, than all<br />
The <i>Hesperian</i> fruite, by jealous Dragon watch'd<br />
Where all delights doe circle appetite,<br />
And pleasures multiply by being tasted,<br />
Should be so lost with thought of one, turne ashes.<br />
There's nothing left my Lord that can excuse you,<br />
Vnlesse you pleade, what I am asham'd to prompt<br />
Your wisedome too? <i>Lo.</i> What that? <i>Cel.</i> That you have plaid<br />
The Surgeon with your selfe. <i>Lo.</i> And am made Eunuch.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> It were much pitty. <i>Lo.</i> Trouble not your selfe,<br />
I could convince your feares with demonstration<br />
That I am man enough, but knew not where<br />
Vntill this meeting beauty dwelt; the court<br />
You talk'd of must be where the queene of love is,<br />
Which moves but with your person, in your eye<br />
Her glory shines, and onely at that flame<br />
Her wanton boy doth light his quickning torch.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> Nay now you complement, I would it did<br />
My Lord for your owne sake. <i>Lor.</i> You would be kind,<br />
And love me then. <i>Cel.</i> My Lord I should be loving<br />
Where I found worth to invite it, and should cherish<br />
A constant man. <i>Lor.</i> Then you should me Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> But is the ice about your heart fallen off,<br />
Can you returne to doe what love commands?<br />
<i>Cupid</i> thou shalt have instand sacrifice,<br />
And I dare be the Priest. <i>Lor.</i> Your hand, your lip,<br />
Now I am proofe gainst all temptation.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> Your meaning my good Lord. <i>Lor.</i> I that have strength<br />
Against thy voyce and beauty, after this<br />
May dare the charmes of womankind, thou art<br />
<i>Bella Maria</i> unprophaned yet,<br />
This Magicke has no power upon my bloud.<br />
Farewell Madam, if you durst be the example<br />
Of chaste as well as faire, thou wert a brave one.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> I hope your Lordship meanes not this for earnest,<br />
Be pleasd to grace a banquet. <i>Lo.</i> Pardon Madam.<br />
<i>Will Sentlove</i> follow, I must laugh at you.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> My Lord I must beseech you stay, for honour<br />
For her whose memory you love best. <i>Lo.</i> Your pleasure.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> And by that vertue you have now profest,<br />
I charge you to beleeve me too, I can<br />
Now glory, that you have beene worth my triall,<br />
Which I beseech you pardon, had not you<br />
So valiantly recoverd in this conflict,<br />
You had beene my triumph, without hope of more<br />
Than my just scorne upon your wanton flame;<br />
Nor will I thinke these noble thoughts grew first<br />
From melancholy, for some femall losse,<br />
As the phantasticke world beleeves, but from<br />
Truth, and your love of Innocence, which shine<br />
So bright in the two royall luminaries<br />
At Court, you cannot lose your way to chastitie,<br />
Proceede, and speake of me as honour guides you.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Exit Lord.</i></span><br />
I am almost tir'd, come Ladies weele beguile<br />
Dull time, and take the aire annother while.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Exeunt.</i></span><br />

<div class="center"><i>Enter Aretina and Servant.</i></div>

<p>
<i>Are.</i> But hath Sir <i>Thomas</i> lost five hundred pounds<br />
Already? <i>Ser.</i> And five hundred more he borrow'd,<br />
The Dice are notable devourers Madam,<br />
They make no more of peeces, than of pebbles,<br />
But thrust their heapes together to engender,<br />
Two hundred more the Caster cries this gentleman,<br />
I am w'ee. I ha that to nothing sir, the Caster<br />
Agen, tis covered, and the table too,<br />
With summes that frighed me, here one sneakes out,<br />
And with a Martyrs patience, smiles upon<br />
His moneyes Executioner, the Dice,<br />
Commands a pipe of good Tobacco, and<br />
I'th smoke on't vanishes; another makes<br />
The bones vault ore his head, sweares that ill throwing<br />
Has put his shoulder out of joynt, calls for<br />
A bone setter that lookes to'th boxe, to bid<br />
His master send him some more hundred pounds,<br />
Which lost, he takes tobacco, and is quiet;<br />
Here a strong arme throwes in, and in, with which<br />
He brusheth all the table, payes the Rookes<br />
That went their smelts a peece upon his hand,<br />
Yet sweares he has not drawne a stake this seven yeare.<br />
But I was bid make haste, my master may<br />
Lose this five hundred pounds ere I come thither.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Exit.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> If we both waste so fast, we shall soone finde<br />
Our state is not immortall, some thing in<br />
His other wayes appeare not well already.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter sir Thomas.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Yee Tortoises, why make you no more haste,<br />
Go pay to'th master of the house that money,<br />
And tell the noble gamsters, I have another<br />
Superfluous thousand pound, at night ile visit em.<br />
Dee heare? <i>Ser.</i> Yes and please you. <i>Bor.</i> Doo't ye drudges,<br />
Ta ra ra&mdash;<i>Aretina</i>. <i>Ar.</i> You have a pleasant humor sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> What should a gentleman be sad? <i>Ar.</i> You have lost.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> A transitory summe, as good that way<br />
As another. <i>Are.</i> Doe you not vexe within for't?<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> I had rather lose a thousand more, than one<br />
Sad thought come neere my heart fort, vexe for trash,<br />
Although it goe from other men like drops<br />
Of their life bloud, we lose with the alacrity,<br />
Wee drinke a cup of sacke, or kisse a Mistris,<br />
No money is considerable with a gamster,<br />
They have soules more spacious than Kings, did two<br />
Gamsters divide the Empire of the world<br />
Theyd make one throw for't all, and he that lost<br />
Be no more melancholy, then to have plai'd for<br />
A mornings draught, vexe a rich soule for dirt,<br />
The quiet of whose every thought is worth<br />
A Province. <i>Are.</i> But when Dice have consumd all,<br />
Your patience will not pawne for as much more.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Hang pawning, sell outright, and the feares over.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Say you so? I'le have another coach to morrow<br />
If there be rich above ground. <i>Bor.</i> I forgot<br />
To bid the fellow aske my Jeweller,<br />
Whether the chaine of Diamonds be made up,<br />
I will present it to my Lady <i>Bellamour</i>,<br />
Faire <i>Celestina</i>. <i>Are.</i> This gowne J have worne<br />
Sixe dayes already, it lookes dull, ile give it<br />
My waiting woman, and have one of cloth<br />
of gold enbrodered, shooes and pantables<br />
Will show well of the same. <i>Bor.</i> I have invited<br />
A covey of Ladies, and as many gentlemen<br />
To morrow to the <i>Italian</i> Ordinary,<br />
I shall have rarities, and regalli as<br />
To pay for Madam, musicke, wanton songs,<br />
And tunes of silken petticotes to dance to.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> And to morrow have I invited halfe the Court<br />
To dine here, what misfortune tis your company<br />
And ours should be devided? after dinner<br />
J entertaine e'm with a play. <i>Bor.</i> By that time<br />
Your play inclines to the Epilogue, shall we<br />
quit our <i>Italian</i> host, and whirle in coaches,<br />
To the Douch Magazine of sawce, the Stillyard,<br />
Where deale, and backragge, and what strange wine else,<br />
They dare but give a name too in the reckoning<br />
Shall flow into our roome, and drowne Westphalias,<br />
Tongues, and Anchoavis, like some little towne<br />
Endangered by a sluce, through whole fierce ebbe<br />
We wade and wash our selves into a boate,<br />
And bid our Coachmen drive their leather tenements<br />
By land, while we saile home with a fresh tide<br />
To some new randevous. <i>Are.</i> If you have not<br />
Pointed the place, pray bring your Ladies hither,<br />
J meane to have a Ball to morrow night,<br />
And a rich banquet for e'm, where we'le dance<br />
Till morning rise, and blush to interrupt us.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Have you no Ladies i'th next roome, to advance<br />
A present mirth? What a dull house you governe?<br />
Farewell, a wife's no company&mdash;<i>Aretina</i>,<br />
J've summ'd up my estate, and find we may have<br />
A month good yet. <i>Are.</i> What meane you? <i>Bo.</i> And Jde rather<br />
Be Lord one moneth of pleasures, to the height<br />
And rapture of our senses, than be yeares,<br />
Consuming what we have in foolish temperance,<br />
Live in the darke, and no fame waite upon us,<br />
I will live so, posterity shall stand<br />
At gaze when I am mentioned. <i>Are.</i> A mon'th good,<br />
And what shall be done then. <i>Bor.</i> Ile over Sea,<br />
And traile a pike, with watching, marching, lying<br />
In trenches, with enduring cold, and hunger,<br />
And taking here and there a musketshot,<br />
I can earne every weeke foure shillings Madam,<br />
And if the bullets favour me to snatch<br />
Any superfluous limbe, when I returne<br />
With good friends, I despaire not to be enrold<br />
Poore Knight of Windsore; for your course Madam,<br />
No doubt you may doe well, your friends are great,<br />
Or if your poverty, and their pride cannot<br />
Agree, you neede not trouble much invention,<br />
To find a trade to live by, there are customers,<br />
Farewell, be frolicke Madam, if I live<br />
I will feast all my senses, and not fall<br />
Lesse than a <i>Phaeton</i> from my throne of Pleasure,<br />
Though my estate flame like the world about me.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Tis very pretty.       <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter Decoy.</i></span><br />

After so sweet a nights worke? Have not I<br />
Shew'd my selfe Mistris of my art. <i>Are.</i> A Lady.<br />
<br />
<i>De.</i> That title makes the credit of the act<br />
A story higher, y'ave not seene him yet,<br />
I wonder what hee'le say. <i>Are.</i> He's here.<br />
<br />
<i>Ale.</i> Beare up       <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter Alexander and Fredericke.</i></span><br />
My little <i>Mirmidan</i>, does not <i>Jacke Littleworth</i><br />
Follow? <i>Fre.</i> Follow? He fell into the Thames<br />
At landing. <i>Alex.</i> The devill shall dive for him<br />
Ere I endanger my silke stockings for him,<br />
Let the Watermen alone, they have drags and engins,<br />
When he has drunke his Julip, I shall laugh<br />
To see him come in pickeld the next tide.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> Hee'le never sinke, he has such a corke braine.<br />
<br />
<i>Ale.</i> Let him be hang'd or drown'd alls one to me,<br />
Yet he deserves to die by water, cannot<br />
Beare his wine credibly. <i>Fre.</i> Is not this my Aunt?<br />
<br />
<i>Ale.</i> And another hansome Lady, I must know her.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> My bloud is rampant too, I must court some body,<br />
As good my Aunt, as any other body.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Where have you beene cozen? <i>Fre.</i> At the bridge,<br />
At the Beares foote, where our first health began<br />
To the faire <i>Aretina</i>, whose sweet company<br />
Was wished by all, we could not get a lay,<br />
a Tumbler, a Device, a <i>bona roba</i><br />
For any money, drawers were growne dull;<br />
We wanted our true firkes and our vagaries;<br />
When were you in drinke Aunt? <i>Are.</i> How? <i>Fr.</i> Do not Ladies<br />
Play the good fellowes too? there's no true mirth<br />
Without e'm, I have now such tickling fancies,<br />
That Doctour of the chaire of wit, has read<br />
A precious lecture, how I should behave<br />
My selfe to Ladies, as now for example.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Would you practise upon me? <i>Fre.</i> I first salute you,<br />
You have a soft hand Madam, are you so<br />
All over? <i>Are.</i> Nephew. <i>Fre.</i> Nay you should but smile,<br />
And then agen I kisse you; and thus draw<br />
Off your white glove, and start to see your hand<br />
More excellently white, I grace my owne<br />
Lip with this touch, and turning gently thus,<br />
Prepare you for my skill in Palmistry,<br />
Which out of curiosity no Lady<br />
But easily applies too, the first line<br />
I tooke with most ambition to find out,<br />
Is <i>Venus</i> girdle, a faire semicircle<br />
Enclosing both the mount of <i>Sol</i> and <i>Saturne</i>,<br />
If that appeare, she's for my turne, a Lady<br />
Whom nature has prepar'd for the careere,<br />
And <i>Cupid</i> at my elbow, I put forward,<br />
You have this very line, Aunt.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> The boy's franticke.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> You have a Couch or Palate, I can shut<br />
The Chamber doore, enrich a stranger when<br />
Your Nephew's comming into play. <i>Are.</i> No more.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> Are you so coy to your owne flesh and bloud?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Here take your playfellow, I talke of sport,<br />
And she would have me marry her.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> Heres <i>Littleworth</i>.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter Littleworth wet.</i></span><br />
Why how now Tutour? <i>Lit.</i> I ha beene fishing.<br />
<br />
<i>Fr.</i> And what ha you caught? <i>Lit.</i> My belly full of water.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Ha ha, wheres thy rapier? <i>Lit.</i> My rapier's is drown'd,<br />
And I am little better, I was up bi'th heeles,<br />
And out came a tun of water beside wine.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> 'T has made thee sober. <i>Lit.</i> Would you have me drunk<br />
With Water? <i>Are.</i> I hope your fire is quenched by this time.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> It is not now, as when your worship walkd<br />
By all the tavernes <i>Jacke</i>, drie as a bone.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> You had store of fish under water <i>Jacke</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> It has made a poore <i>John</i> of me.<br />
<br />
<i>Fre.</i> J doe not thinke but if we cast an angle<br />
Jnto his belly, we might find some Pilchards.<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> And boild by this time, deere Madam a bed.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Carry but the water Spaniel to a grasseplot<br />
Where he may roule himselfe, let him but shake<br />
His eares twice in the Sunne, and you may grind him<br />
Into a posset. <i>Fre.</i> Come thou shalt to my bed<br />
Poore pickerell. <i>De.</i> Alas sweete gentleman.<br />
<br />
<i>Lit.</i> I have ill lucke, and I should smell by this time,<br />
I am but new tane I am sure, sweet gentlewoman.<br />
<br />
<i>De.</i> Your servant. <i>Lit.</i> Pray doe not plucke off my skin,<br />
It is so wet, unlesse you have good eyes<br />
You'le hardly know it from a shirt. <i>De.</i> Feare nothing.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> He has sacke enough, and I may find his humor.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Exeunt.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> And how ist with your Ladiship? you looke<br />
Without a sunshine in your face. <i>Are.</i> You are glorious<br />
In mind and habit. <i>Al.</i> Ends of gold and silver.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Your other clothes were not so rich, who was<br />
Your tailor sir? <i>Al.</i> They were made for me long since,<br />
They have knowne but two bright dayes upon my backe,<br />
I had a humor Madam to lay things by,<br />
They will serve two dayes more, I thinke I ha gold enough<br />
To goe to'th Mercer, Ile now allow my selfe<br />
A suite a weeke as this, with necessary<br />
Dependances, Beaver, silke stockings, garters,<br />
And roses in their due conformitie,<br />
Bootes are forbid a cleane legge, but to ride in,<br />
My linnen every morning comes in new,<br />
The old goes too great bellies. <i>Ar.</i> You are charitable.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> I may dine w'ee sometime, or at the Court<br />
To meete good company, not for the table,<br />
My Clarke o'th Kitchins here, a witty Epicure,<br />
A spirit that to please me with whats rare<br />
Can flie a hundred mile a day to market,<br />
And make me Lord of Fish and Foule, I shall<br />
Forget there is a butcher, and to make<br />
My footmen nimble, he shall feede on nothing<br />
But wings of wildfoule. <i>Are.</i> These wayes are costly.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> Therefore Ile have it so, I ha sprung a mine.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> You make me wonder sir, to see this change<br />
Of fortune, your revenew was not late<br />
So plentifull. <i>Al.</i> Hang durty land and Lordships,<br />
I wonot change one lodging I ha got<br />
For the Chamber of London. <i>Are.</i> Strange of such a sudden,<br />
To rise to this estate, no fortunate hand<br />
At dice could lift you up so, for tis since<br />
Last night, yesterday, you were no such Monarke.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> There be more games then dice. <i>Are.</i> It cannot be<br />
A Mistris, though your person is worth love,<br />
None possibly are rich enough to feed<br />
As you have cast the method of your riots,<br />
A Princesse, after all her Jewels must<br />
Be forc'd to sell her provinces. <i>Al.</i> Now you talke<br />
Of Jewels? What doe you thinke of this? <i>Are.</i> A rich one.<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> You'le honour me to wear't, this other toy<br />
I had from you, this chaine I borrowed of you,<br />
A friend had it in keeping, if your Ladiship<br />
Want any summe, you know your friend and <i>Alexander</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Dare you trust my security. <i>Al.</i> There's gold,<br />
I shall have more to morrow.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> You astonish me, who can supply these?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> A deare friend I have,<br />
She promisd we should meete agen i'th morning.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Not that I wish to know<br />
More of your happinesse, then I have aready<br />
Heart to congratulate, be pleasd to lay<br />
My wonder. <i>Al.</i> Tis a secret. <i>Are.</i> Which ile die<br />
Ere Ile betray. <i>Al.</i> You have alwayes wish'd me well,<br />
But you shall sweare not to reveale the partie.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Ile lose the benefit of my tongue. <i>Alex.</i> Nor be<br />
Afraid at what I say, what thinke you first<br />
Of an old Witch, a strange ill favor'd hag<br />
That for my company last night, has wrought<br />
This cure upon my fortune? I doe sweat<br />
To thinke upon her name. <i>Are.</i> How sir a Witch?<br />
<br />
<i>Ale.</i> I would not fright your Ladiship too much<br />
At first, but Witches are a kin to Spirits,<br />
The truth is&mdash;nay if you looke pale already,<br />
I ha done. <i>Are.</i> Sir I beseech you. <i>Ale.</i> If you have<br />
But courage then to know the truth, ile tell you<br />
In one word, my chiefe friend is the devill.<br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> What devill? How I tremble. <i>Ale.</i> Have a heart,<br />
Twas a shee devill too, a most insatiate<br />
Abominable devill with a taile<br />
Thus long. <i>Are.</i> Goodnesse defend me, did you see her?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> No twas i'th darke, but she appeard first to me<br />
I'th likenesse of a Bedlam, and was brought<br />
I know not how, nor whither, by two Goblins,<br />
More hooded than a Hawke. <i>Are.</i> But would you venter<br />
Vpon a devill? <i>Al.</i> I for meanes. <i>Are.</i> How blacke<br />
An impudence is this? But are you sure<br />
It was the devill you enjoy'd. <i>Al.</i> Say nothing,<br />
I did the best to please her, but as sure<br />
As you live, twas a Helcat. <i>Are.</i> Dee not quake?<br />
<br />
<i>Al.</i> I found my selfe the very same i'th morning,<br />
Where two of her familiars had left me.       <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter Servant.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Ser.</i> My Lord is come to visite you. <i>Al.</i> No words,<br />
As you respect my safety, I ha told tales<br />
Out of the devills schoole, if it be knowne<br />
I lose a friend, tis now about the time<br />
I promis'd her to meete agen, at my<br />
Returne Ile tell you wonders, not a word.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Exit.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Are.</i> Tis a false glasse, sure I am more deform'd,<br />
What have I done, my soule is miserable.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter Lord.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> I sent you a letter Madam. <i>Are.</i> You exprest<br />
Your noble care of me my Lord.       <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter Bornwell, Celestina.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Your Lordship<br />
Does me an honour. <i>Lor.</i> Madam I am glad<br />
To see you here, I meant to have kist your hand<br />
Ere my returne to Court. <i>Cel.</i> Sir <i>Thomas</i> has<br />
Prevaild to bring me to his trouble hither.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> You doe him grace. <i>Bor.</i> Why whats the matter Madam?<br />
Your eyes are tuning <i>Lachrimæ</i>. <i>Are.</i> As you<br />
Doe hope for heaven withdraw, and give me but<br />
The patience of ten minutes. <i>Born.</i> Wonderfull!<br />
I wonot heare you above that proportion,<br />
Shee talkes of heaven, come, where must we to counsell?<br />
<br />
<i>Ar.</i> You shall conclude me when you please. <i>Bo.</i> I follow.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> What alteration is this? I that so late<br />
Stood the temptation of her eye, and voyce,<br />
Boasted a heart, 'bove all licentious flame,<br />
At second veiw turne renegade, and thinke<br />
I was too superstitious, and full<br />
Of phlegme not to reward her amorous Courtship<br />
With manly freedome. <i>Cel.</i> I obey you sir.<br />
<br />
<i>Bor.</i> Ile waite upon your Lordship presently.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> She could not want a cunning to seeme honest<br />
When I neglected her, I am resolv'd,<br />
You still looke pleasant Madam. <i>Cel.</i> I have cause<br />
My Lord, the rather for your presence, which<br />
Hath power to charme all trouble in my thoughts.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> I must translate that complement and owe<br />
All that is cheerefull in my selfe to these<br />
All quickning smiles, and rather than such bright<br />
Eyes should repent their influence upon me,<br />
I would release the aspects, and quit the bountie<br />
Of all the other starres; Did you not thinke me<br />
A strange and melancholy gentleman<br />
To use you so unkindly. <i>Cel.</i> Me my Lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> I hope you made no loude complaint, I wod not<br />
Be tride by a Jury of Ladies. <i>Cel.</i> For what my Lord?<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> I did not meete that noble entertainment,<br />
You were late pleasd to shew me. <i>Cel.</i> I observd<br />
No such defect in your Lorship, but a brave<br />
And noble fortitude. <i>Lor.</i> A noble folly<br />
I bring repentance fort, I know you have<br />
Madam a gentle faith, and wonot ruine<br />
What you have built to honour you. <i>Cel.</i> Whats that?<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> If you can love, ile tell your Ladiship.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> I have a stubborne soule else. <i>Lor.</i> You are all<br />
Composd of harmony. <i>Cel.</i> What love de'e meane?<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> That which doth perfect both, Madam you have heard<br />
I can be constant, and if you consent<br />
To grace it so, there is a spacious dwelling<br />
Prepar'd within my heart for such a Mistrisse.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> Your Mistris, my good Lord? <i>Lor.</i> Why my good Lady?<br />
Your sexe doth hold it no dishonour<br />
To become Mistris to a noble servant<br />
In the now court, Platonicke way, consider<br />
Who tis that pleades to you, my birth, and present<br />
Value can be no staine to your embrace,<br />
But these are shadowes when my love appeares,<br />
Which shall in his first miracle returne<br />
Me in my bloome of youth, and thee a Virgin,<br />
When I within some new <i>Elisium</i><br />
Of purpose made and meant for us, shall be<br />
In every thing <i>Adonis</i>, but in his<br />
Contempt of love, and court thee from a <i>Daphne</i><br />
Hid in the cold rinde of a bashfull tree,<br />
With such warme language, and delight, till thou<br />
Leape from that bayes into the queene of love,<br />
And pay my conquest with composing garlands<br />
Of thy owne mirtle for me. <i>Cel.</i> Whats all this?<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> Consent to be my Mistris <i>Celestina</i>,<br />
And we will have it Spring-time all the yeare,<br />
Vpon whose invitations when we walke,<br />
The windes shall play soft descant to our feete,<br />
And breathe rich odors to repure the aire,<br />
Greene bowers on every side shall tempt our stay,<br />
And Violets stoope to have us treade upon em.<br />
The red rose shall grow pale, being neere thy cheeke,<br />
And the white blush orecome with such a forehead,<br />
Here laid, and measuring with our selves some banke,<br />
A thousand birds shall from the woods repaire,<br />
And place themselves so cunningly, behinde<br />
The leaves of every tree, that while they pay<br />
As tribute of their songs, thou shalt imagine<br />
The very trees beare musicke, and sweet voyces<br />
Doe grow in every arbour, here can we<br />
Embrace and kisse, tell tales, and kisse agen,<br />
And none but heaven our rivall. <i>Cel.</i> When we are<br />
Weary of these, what if we shift our Paradise?<br />
And through a grove of tall and even pine,<br />
Descend into a Vally, that shall shame<br />
All the delights of <i>Tempe</i>, upon whose<br />
Greene plush the graces shall be cald to dance<br />
To please us, and maintaine their Fairy revells,<br />
To the harmonious murmurs of a streame<br />
That gently falls upon a rocke of pearle,<br />
Here doth the Nimph forsaken Eccho dwell,<br />
To whom we'le tell the story of our love,<br />
Till at our surfet and her want of joy,<br />
We breake her heart with envy, not farre off<br />
A grove shall call us to a wanton river,<br />
To see a dying Swan give up the ghost,<br />
The fishes shooting up their teares in bubbles<br />
That they must lose the Genius of their waves,<br />
And such love linsey woolsey, to no purpose.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> You chide me hansomely, pray tell me how<br />
You like this language. <i>Cel.</i> Good my Lord forbeare.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> You neede not flie out of this circle Madam,<br />
These widowes so are full of circumstance,<br />
Ile undertake in this time I ha courted<br />
Your Ladiship for the toy, to ha broken ten,<br />
Nay twenty colts, Virgins I meane, and taught em<br />
The amble, or what pace I most affected.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> Y'are not my Lord agen, the Lord I thought you,<br />
And I must tell you now, you doe forget<br />
Your selfe and me. <i>Lor.</i> You'le not be angry Madam.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> Nor rude, though gay men have a priviledge,<br />
It shall appeare, there is a man my Lord<br />
Within my acquaintance, rich in worldly fortunes,<br />
But cannot boast any descent of bloud,<br />
Would buy a coate of armes. <i>Lor.</i> He may, and legges<br />
booted and spurr'd to ride into the countrey.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> But these will want antiquitie: my Lord<br />
The seale of honour, whats a coate cut out<br />
But yesterday to make a man a gentleman?<br />
Your family as old, as the first vertue<br />
That merited an Escucheon, doth owe<br />
A glorious coat of armes, if you will sell now<br />
All that your name doth challenge in that ensigne,<br />
Ile helpe you to a chapman, that shall pay<br />
And powre downe wealth enough fort. <i>Lor.</i> Sell my armes?<br />
I cannot Madam. <i>Cel.</i> Give but your consent,<br />
You know not how the state may be enclind<br />
To dispensation, we may prevaile<br />
Vpon the Heralds office afterward.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> Ile sooner give these armess to'th hangmans axe,<br />
My head, my heart, to twenty executions<br />
Than sell one atome from my name. <i>Cel.</i> Change that,<br />
And answer him would buy my honour from me.<br />
Honour that is not worne upon a flagge<br />
Or pennon, that without the owners dangers,<br />
An enemy may ravish, and beare from me,<br />
But that which growes and withers with my soule,<br />
Beside the bodies staine, think, thinke my Lord<br />
To what you would unworthily betray me,<br />
If you would not for price of gold, or pleasure,<br />
(If that be more your idoll) lose the glory<br />
And painted honour of your house&mdash;&mdash;I ha done.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> Enough to rectifie a Satires bloud,<br />
Obscure my blushes here.      <span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Enter Sentlove and Hairecut.</i></span><br />
<br />
<i>Ha.</i> Or this or fight with me,<br />
It shall be no exception that I waite<br />
Vpon my Lord, I am a gentleman,<br />
You may be lesse and be a Knight, the office,<br />
I doe my Lord is honest sir, how many<br />
Such you have beene guilty of, heaven knowes.<br />
<br />
<i>Sent.</i> Tis no feare of your sword, but that I wod not<br />
Breake the good lawes established against duells.<br />

<i>Ha.</i> Off with your periwig, and stand bare. <i>Lor.</i> From this<br />
Minute ile be a servant to thy goodnesse,<br />
A Mistris in the wanton sence is common,<br />
Ile honor you with chaste thoughts, and call you so.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> Ile study to be worth your faire opinion.<br />
<br />
<i>Lor.</i> <i>Sentlove</i>, your head was usd to a covering,<br />
Beside a hat, when went the haire away.<br />
<br />
<i>Sent.</i> I laid a wager my Lord with <i>Hairecut</i>,<br />
Who thinkes I shall catch cold, that ile stand bare<br />
This halfe houre. <i>Ha.</i> Pardon my ambition<br />
Madam, I told you truth, I am a gentleman,<br />
And cannot feare that name is drown'd in my<br />
Relation to my Lord. <i>Cel.</i> I dare not thinke so.<br />
<br />
<i>Ha.</i> From henceforth call my service duty Madam,<br />
That Pigges head that betraid me to your mirth,<br />
Is doing penance for't. <i>Sent.</i> Why may not I<br />
My Lord begin a fashion of no haire.<br />
<br />
<i>Cel.</i> Doe you sweat sir William. <i>Sent.</i> Not with store of nightcaps.<br />

Humility. <i>Al.</i> Low as my heart. Sir <i>Thomas</i><br />
